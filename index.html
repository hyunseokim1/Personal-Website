        Crab Shucked Weight Prediction
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
            Based on Kaggle's Crab data set, explored how Possible explanatory variables and Possible dummy variables affect predicting the weight of crabs. 
            </li>
            <li>Selected the Final Model that best shows the relationship between explanatory and response variables through organizing full model, transformation, and variable selection.</li>
            <li>Write and present a final report on Data description, Results and interpretation, and Limitations/Future Improvements of the Final model.</li>
